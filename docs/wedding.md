Malaysia plan:

# Where can I stay?
We're looking at different AirBnB options right now, but otherwise Exeter has a number of hotels or BnBs that should work.
Exeter's not a huge place, so anything close enough to the train stations (Central, St Davids, St Thomas) will be pretty walkable to all our wedding stop-offs.

# Do I have to get you something?
No, but if you feel you *absolutely have to* get us something, we're putting together a list to make this easier for people.
The list so far is available through this link:  
[https://www.johnlewis.com/wish-list/TTTNFVK](https://www.johnlewis.com/wish-list/TTTNFVK)  
If you pick something from the list, we'll remove it!

Other vendors we like if you want to shop small (in Exeter):
- Maker Maker, Magdalen Road
- Helen of Troy, Fore Street
- Maker Mart, Gandy Street
- Smith's Wines, Magdalen Road
- Tappermade, [Magical internet land](https://tappermade.com/)
- Crankhouse Coffee, Fore Street
- Or go rogue and stray from the list, we also like surprises!

If you want to buy us coffee stuff, we already have a lot of equipment, please check with us first (Mia wants another set of espresso cups).

# What should I wear?
The ceremony is on grass so avoid skinny heels. Don't feel obliged to wear a three-piece suit if it's 30 degrees, we want everybody to be comfortable. Think beach-formal!

# Should I eat lunch?
Yes! Please eat beforehand, we recommend a small lunch or big brunch as food service will be an early dinner!

# Where can I park?
For people leaving on Sunday, there are some residents areas which you can park on the roadside during weekends. We recommend parking anywhere around the St Leonard's area for maximum convenience.

For others, here's some car parks that we know around the area, all are walkable to the venue:
- Magdalen Road car park (day rate - £18.00; 5-10min walk to venue)
- Triangle car park (day rate - £13.00; 20min walk to venue)
- Belmont Road car park (day rate - £11.00; 25min walk to venue)

These are just a few, more options are available on the [Exeter City Council Website](https://exeter.gov.uk/car-parking/).

# What to do?
## Food and drink
- Stage - _(Saturday only)_ We visited so regularly you can see Brandon outside on Google Maps Street View. If you want slightly more boujie dinner out, they do a 6 course tasting menu that we highly recommend. They also do great drinks.
- Calvo Loco - _(Saturday only)_ Our favourite Tapas place, we recommend booking in advance.
- Goto Japanese - _(Saturday only)_ Mia's favourite Ramen in the country. Also does great Sushi. 
- iFood Thai Taste - Amazing Thai food. 
- Prospect Inn - Classic pub food on the Quay.
- Double locks - a nice walking trail along the river side ending with a pub (approx 30mins walk from the quay).
- Firehouse - Like Harry Potter? We don't. But we like Firehouse. Known for it's square pizzas and Sunday roasts (vegan friendly).
- The Press House - Best Brunch in Exeter, get there early.

## Coffee shops we like
- Crankhouse - _(Saturday only)_ Exeter's most iconic local roastery.
- Common beaver - Our go to Sunday morning spot (we recommend the batch filter). Also has bagels. Mia accredited this place with starting her unhinged coffee obsession.
- 18grams - Local micro-roastery, we recommend for espresso and milk drinks. Brandon accredited this place with starting his ability to drink coffee.
- Lilac Bakery - A little off the beaten track but incredible pastries (and still closer than Paris!).

If you really want to get caffeinated, try doing all 4 in one day, then follow up with Dance Dance Revolution at Boneyard Arcade!

## Activities
- Fore street - _(Saturday only)_ Cute indie shopping street.
- Magdalen Road - _(Saturday only)_ Our little Exeter community with even more cute indie shops.
- Gandy street - Like Harry Potter? Something, something, Diagon alley... Check out Maker Mart, it's cute.
- Boneyard Retro Arcade - Pay £5 for 20 plays on a selection of vintage and restored cabinets.
- Walk along the quayside - There will be live Jazz on Sunday.
- Satellite trip to Exmouth - Beach.
- Satellite trip to Dartmoor - Moor.
